/*If we open our package.json >> Under dependencies, we have react, react-dom and react-script
* REACT : - This is our react package
* REACT DOM : - This takes care of DOM manipulations
* REACT SCRIPT : - This takes care of building, testing, ejecting etc..

These 3 dependencies already implemented a lot of popular dependencies under the hood e.g. Webpack and Babel but those many dependencies are not shown to make the file simpler.

To view this dependencies >> Run "npm run eject", This eject the app and you see all those dependencies.... DO NOT TRY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE AN ADVANCED DEVELOPER*/
