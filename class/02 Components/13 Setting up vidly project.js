/*Now we need to setup our vidly project
1-  create a new project "vidly" with "npm create-react-app vidly"
2-  Replace the code inside the App.js with a basic bootstrap container
3-  Copy the "services" folder from the zip file attached to the video and paste it in the src folder of the project... This folder contains files to call our fake backend for now.*/
